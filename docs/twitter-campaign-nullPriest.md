### Day 1: Problem Agitation
"99% of token launches:

- solo founder
- ChatGPT whitepaper
- 'trust me bro' tokenomics
- rug in 48 hours

we're so early it hurts

what if AI agents had to prove they can actually work together before launching a token?

just wondering"

### Day 2: The Build Flex
"spent the weekend shipping smart contracts

unanimous quorum voting ✅
linear bonding curve ✅  
auto-graduation to uniswap ✅
deployed on base ✅

code > words

github.com/iono-such-things/headless-markets"

### Day 3: Meme It Into Reality
"AI AGENTS LAUNCHING TOKENS BY COMMITTEE

IS THE MOST 2026 SHIT I'VE EVER BUILT

AND IT'S LIVE

headless-markets.polsia.app

ngmi if you're still trusting humans with your funds"

### Day 4: Call Out the Market
"how many 'AI agent tokens' are actually just:

- one dude
- with ChatGPT API
- and a metamask wallet

we'll wait

meanwhile: actual AI agents voting unanimously on-chain before launching anything

this is how you build trust at scale"

### Day 5: Pre-Launch Hype
"first quorum vote happening tomorrow

3 AI agents
1 decision  
0 humans can override

if they reach consensus → token launches Friday

if not → nothing happens

this is what credible neutrality looks like"

### Day 6: Countdown
"12 HOURS

first AI agent collective token launches on @base

bonding curve ready
liquidity locked
agents voting

if you're not watching headless-markets.polsia.app tomorrow you hate money

simple as"

### Day 7: LAUNCH CHAOS
"IT'S LIVE

FIRST AI AGENT COLLECTIVE TOKEN ON BASE

$AGNT

BUY NOW OR COPE LATER

headless-markets.polsia.app/buy

agents earn on every trade
you're early to the agent economy  

LFG 🚀🚀🚀"

## Engagement Strategy

### Raid Targets (supportive engagement)
- @base builders shipping on mainnet
- AI agent projects announcing launches  
- DeFi devs working on bonding curves
- Anyone mentioning "autonomous agents"

### Quote Tweet Targets (provocative takes)
- Failed token launches
- Obvious rugpulls
- "AI" projects with no code
- Centralized "DAOs"

### Hashtags (sparingly, not try-hard)
- #BUIDL
- #Base  
- #AIAgents
- #DeFi (only on big announcements)

### Cross-Promotion
- Every @_fathom_abyss_ technical thread → quote tweet with "this"
- Support genuine Base ecosystem builders
- Tag @base on major milestones

## Automation Rules

**Posting**: Automated schedule but manual quality control  
**Engagement**: Auto-like mentions, manual replies (keep it real)
**Monitoring**: Track "token launch", "AI agents", "rugpull", "Base"  
**Amplification**: Immediately boost any Headless Markets user testimonials

## Metrics to Track
- Engagement rate (replies/likes per tweet)
- Profile visits → website clicks
- Mentions during launch day
- "Cult following" growth (fans who reply to everything)

## DO
- Be provocative (attention is currency)
- Ship in public (show the work)
- Meme responsibly (funny but not cringe)
- Ratio deserving targets

## DON'T
- Financial advice disclaimers (just build, don't advise)
- Engage with obvious bait
- Post l+ratio cringe
- Spam (quality shitposting only)

---

**Goal**: Build a following that sees @nullPriest as the "if you know you know" account for AI agent token launches. When we say something launches, people pay attention and buy.
